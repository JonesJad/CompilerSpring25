The following is a semester-wide coding project that I worked on during the spring of 2025 at Swarthmore College, under the direction of professor Zachary Palmer, and with one other partner. 
The goal of this project was to understand compiling techniques and principles by creating a compiler that converts an imaginary language into assembly code that can be used on any system. 
This project was completed mostly in OCaml and the language that it has been created to work on is based closely on the syntax of that langauge. 
There are multiple branches of this project, with each adding new features to the compiling process, which are listed below: 

Auklet - Unary/Binary Operations
Bluebird - More Syntax/ Unique binary representation for Booleans
Cardinal - Runtime checks for misused values
Dove - First-order functions / Compile-time errors
Eagle - Heap-allocated Tuples 
Falcon - First-class Functions and Partial Application 
Lorikeet - Parrallelism/Threading
Gull - Variable Mutation / Garbage Collection
Hoopoe - Tail-call optimization (better recursion for loops) 
Pyrrhuloxia - A unique parser for the language 

The current branch uploaded is PYRRHULOXIA
